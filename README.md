# Image Classification with PyTorch

## Overview

This project involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch. The goal is to classify images into 10 different classes. This README provides an overview of the project, requirements, and instructions on how to run the code.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
```

Clone the repository and then run the PyTorchClassifier with 
```bash
python PyTorchClassifier.py
```
